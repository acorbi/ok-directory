Open Knowledge Directory for individuals and organizations
=========

The Open Steps Directory contains the list of individuals and organisations we have met and/or collaborated with along our journey. It represents an attempt to gather information and contact details about the persons, groups and collectives that work actively with Open Knowledge and play an important role supporting the principles behind Open Cultures.. The project addresses two goals:

* connect data journalists around the world
* help them to find experts in their country/city
