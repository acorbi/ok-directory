## The project

The Open Steps Directory contains the list of individuals and organisations we have met and/or collaborated with along our journey. It represents an attempt to gather information and contact details about the persons, groups and collectives that work actively with Open Knowledge and play an important role supporting the principles behind Open Cultures.. The project addresses two goals:

* connect data journalists around the world
* help them to find experts in their country/city

## About Open Steps

* Open Steps : A journey around the world discovering and showcasing Open Knowledge projects

Open Steps is an initiative from two young berliners Alex Corbi (spanish, software developer) and Margo Thierry (french, european politics) who decided to leave their daily lives in July 2013 and travel around the world for one year. The purpose of this journey is to meet people and organisations actively working in Open Knowledge related projects while divulging the principles behind this topic.
